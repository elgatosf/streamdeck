 * Requests the Stream Deck switches the current profile of the specified {@link deviceId} to the {@link profile}; when no {@link profile} is provided the previously active profile
 * is activated.
 *
 * NB: Plugins may only switch to profiles distributed with the plugin, as defined within the manifest, and cannot access user-defined profiles.
 * @param deviceId Unique identifier of the device where the profile should be set.
 * @param profile Optional name of the profile to switch to; when `undefined` the previous profile will be activated. Name must be identical to the one provided in the manifest.
 * @param page Optional page to show when switching to the {@link profile}, indexed from 0. When `undefined`, the page that was previously visible (when switching away from the
 * profile) will be made visible.
 * @returns `Promise` resolved when the request to switch the `profile` has been sent to Stream Deck.
